2010-08-29  Bill Poser  <poser@khunekcho.khunek>

2008-04-26  Bill Poser  <poser@khunekcho.khunek.poser.org>

	to the combination defxy.

	Added expansion of ligatures U+FB00,U+FB01,U+FB02,U+FB03,U+FB04, U+FB06 to -x option.

	Added conversion of U+00AF, U+2215, U+2216, U+2223 to -e option.

	Error messages now include the line number.

	Microsoft-style HTML entities lacking final semi-colon are now
