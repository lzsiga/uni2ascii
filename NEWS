2011-02-16 4.17
Added to uni2ascii the following conversions to nearest ascii equivalent:
       U+2022 bullet to 'o'
       U+00B7 middle dot to period
       U+0085 next line  to newline
       U+2028 line separator to newline

2010-12-12 4.16
Ascii2uni Q format now works again.
Added U+2033 to characters converted to nearest ascii equivalent by uni2ascii B option.

2010-08-29 4.15
Renamed endian.h u2a_endian.h to avoid conflict with external endian.h.
Removed getline() from ascii2uni.c since it is standard as of POSIX2008.

2009-08-04 4.14
Fixed a bug that interfered with the use of the Q format in uni2ascii.
Fixed bug in which ascification of U+2502 and U+2503 added double quote to output.
Fixed a bug in which -a S option generated a "Converted so many chars" line for each
character due to leaving in debugging code.

2009-04-22 4.13
Fixed Debian bug #511527 which caused the count of characters converted
to ASCII by uni2ascii to be excessive.</li>

2009-03-25 4.12
Both programs now allow the input file name to be specified on the command
line without redirection.

2008-10-02 4.11
Added support for %uXXXX format.
Added support for <XX><XX> format.

2008-08-30 version 4.10
Fixed bug that made Y argument to -a flag in ascii2uni a no-op.
Added documentation for Y argument to -a flag to man page for ascii2uni.
Corrected documentation for Q argument to -a flag in man page for ascii2uni.
The help flag for both programs now provides correct information about the
    Q argument to the -a flag.
Giving Y as the argument to the -a flag is now an error for uni2ascii.
The action summary is now more informative. The new version is incompatible
    with u2a, which I am no longer updating. The old action summary can be
    chosen at configuration time by using the option --disable-newsummary.
More informative version information is now provided.

2008-05-06 version 4.9
Fixed bug that produced bad output or segfault if a line
ended in the prefix to an escape, e.g. just an =-sign
in quoted-printable format.

In quoted-printable format if a line ends in an =-sign,
both the equal sign and the following newline are skipped
in accordance with RFC2045.

2008-05-04 version 4.8
Fixes serious bug in ascii2uni due to inclusion in release of test version.

2008-04-26 version 4.7
Added -P option to pass through untransformed Unicode.
Added -B option as shorthand for defxy.
Added characters to -e and -x options (see ChangeLog for details).
Since hardly anyone seems to use it, the GUI u2a is no longer being developed.

2008-03-25 version 4.6
Replaced fgets call with GNU getline so as to handle arbitrarily long input lines.
Added support for OOXML format (e.g. _x00E9_).
Fixed bug affecting BYTEQ, BYTED, and BYTEH formats.

2008-03-20 version 4.5
Error messages now include the line number.

Microsoft-style HTML entities lacking final semi-colon are now
passed on by default rather than converted. The new -m flag
causes them to be converted.

2008-01-14 version 4.4
Added -y option for single-character ascii approximations
as per patch provided by Jesse Peterson (jesse.peterson@exbiblio.com)
Changed license to GPL v.3
